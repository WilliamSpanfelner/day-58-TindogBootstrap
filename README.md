# How Bootstrap CSS might be used to style a dating website for dogs.
- 👋 Hi, I’m @WilliamSpanfelner
- 👀 I’m interested in using Python with Swift in iOS environments and why it may or may not be desirable.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with the London App Brewery and Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: 
The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy.  
- 🧑‍💻 Tindog is a site exploiting the use of Bootstrap for styling purposes.  Bootstrap grid features in addition to fontawesome icons and Google fonts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on application development.
